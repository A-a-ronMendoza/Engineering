<p> The first day we learned about the enginering process and saftey in the workshop. Later, we had a test on saftey on friday.   <br> Wednsday we learned how to use sketchup and we were given our first project on the Rube Goldberg Machine. Finally on friday we did a second challenge that envolved modeling a appliance or object in 45 minutes then being gudged on them. I did not win </p>

<p>The third week was a short week. Monday was off due to labor day and friday was a half day due to back to school night. The first class period we revisited the Rube Goldberg machine to decide as a group whos desighn to focus on. Mine was chosen as the overall best and simplest in my group. <br> The second class period, the 9th we had a short day. In the 30 minutes of class we had to make a capital E using presise messurements. I learned that that can be alot harder than it sounds. After we drew the E with all its dimetions we traded desighns and cut out the E using the messurements from the other persons desighn. I got to learn the very basics of how an engeener thinks and builds in a fun way! </p>

<p>The Fourth week of shool we focused on building our rube goldberg machine. On monday we started building the machenism out of cardboard. Monday was quicker because of the banking day schedule. <br> Wenseday was not so smoth. Some of our messurement were to far off to fix and the folding did not work out well. We learned that in the real world the desighn would go back to the cad desighner to re-think the broken part. Thankfuly we got cleaared to continue and nearly finshed our build. Finally on friday we made boats out of a single peice of paper and add weights. Who ever lasted the longest with the most weight won. My groups boat sank almost emidiatly because it had limmited surface area. We also relized that the boat had too much weight and would sing anyway.  </p>
