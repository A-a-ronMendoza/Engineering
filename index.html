<p>The second week was a short week. Monday was off due to labor day and friday was a half day due to back to school night. The first class period we revisited the Rube Goldberg machine to decide as a group whos desighn to focus on. Mine was chosen as the overall best and simplest in my group. <br> The second class period, the 9th we had a short day. In the 30 minutes of class we had to make a capital E using presise messurements. I learned that that can be alot harder than it sounds. After we drew the E with all its dimetions we traded desighns and cut out the E using the messurements from the other persons desighn. I got to learn the very basics of how an engeener thinks and builds in a fun way! </p>
