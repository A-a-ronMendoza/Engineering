<h2><u>Hello</u></h2>
<h3>I am Human and I enjoy partaking in a multitude of vigorus physical activities such as playing sports </h3>    

<p> The first day we learned about the enginering process and saftey in the workshop. Later, we had a test on saftey on friday.   <br> Wednsday we learned how to use sketchup and we were given our first project on the Rube Goldberg Machine. Finally on friday we did a second challenge that envolved modeling a appliance or object in 45 minutes then being gudged on them. I did not win </p>

<p>The third week was a short week. Monday was off due to labor day and friday was a half day due to back to school night. The first class period we revisited the Rube Goldberg machine to decide as a group whos desighn to focus on. Mine was chosen as the overall best and simplest in my group. <br> The second class period, the 9th we had a short day. In the 30 minutes of class we had to make a capital E using presise messurements. I learned that that can be alot harder than it sounds. After we drew the E with all its dimetions we traded desighns and cut out the E using the messurements from the other persons desighn. I got to learn the very basics of how an engeener thinks and builds in a fun way! </p>

<p>The Fourth week of school we focused on building our rube goldberg machine. On monday we started building the machenism out of cardboard. Monday was quicker because of the banking day schedule. <br> Wenseday was not so smoth. Some of our messurement were to far off to fix and the folding did not work out well. We learned that in the real world the desighn would go back to the cad desighner to re-think the broken part. Thankfuly we got cleaared to continue and nearly finshed our build. Finally on friday we made boats out of a single peice of paper and add weights. Who ever lasted the longest with the most weight won. My groups boat sank almost emidiatly because it had limmited surface area. We also relized that the boat had too much weight and would sing anyway.  </p>
    
<p>The fith week of school we finialized and tested our rubegoldberg machine. On manday we add the finishing toutches to our contraption and reinforeced all of the taped areas with duct tape. On wedensday we were orginalally meant to take state a standardized test, but our school administration had the bright idea to have 1000 students login in at once. Odviously that was a bad idea so we wasted 1 hour of our class time. On top of that my groups contraption was droped by a coustodian which resulted in half the structure breaking. That day I learned that the school admins are not the smartest. Thankfuly we were able to fix the machine in time and compleated the project. On friday we went to another class and watched them test, they had very different ideas. After testing our machine we relized that our rap was very finikey and needed work, so in the future I would improve the ramp.   </p>
  
<p>Week six: On monday we got a lesson on computer enginering by a guest speaker. He explained in depth, what a computer engeeners job was and the componets of a computer. He taught us breifly on the CPU, GPU, RAM, and other key parts. On wedensday we dissasembled old and broken laptops. We got a chance to see all the parts inside of a computer first hand. On friday we finished dissambling the laptop and so we had to reassemble the computers at the last hour of class. I reassembled the computer with no troubble unlike other groups. </p>
